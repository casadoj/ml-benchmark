    Configuration of a model evaluation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : str
        Name of the model. It must match the directory `data/<model>`.
    domains : list[str]
        Domains to evaluate.
    experiments : dict[str, list[str] | None]
        Training experiment -> test experiments to evaluate. None (an empty entry
        in the YAML file) means all the tests of that training experiment defined
        in `benchmark/experiments.yaml`. A plain list of training experiments
        (the former format) is also accepted and means all their tests.
    variables : list[str]
        Variables to evaluate.
    max_members : int, default 5
        Maximum number of ensemble members, randomly selected (with a fixed seed)
        by `ml-eval benchmark`, used to score ensemble predictions. 1 scores a
        single random member. Ignored for deterministic models.
